## Introduction

This is a small Christmas homework project. A 2D array of 7 rows; one for each day, and 24 columns; one for each hour contains temperature readings. The array, Readings, is automatically filled with random float values between -20.00 and 50.00. The user can then choose from a list of actions including replacing values, showing averages, and more. It can handle range and type errors and will correct the user if erroneous data is entered. 

extra note: I forgot to commit basically all of my changes until the very end but I didn't use AI or copy others' codes
